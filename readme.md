This batch file will reset your 5gb limit on MegaDownloader.

Run 'megafix.bat' every time your download stops or hits a very slow speed.

Run 'megafix_silent.bat' if you don't want to be bothered with a Y/N option or are automating with JDownloader.

You *don't* have to reboot your computer, router or modem.
Just run the batch, and voila.

**I haven't tested this on too many Windows machines, so YMMV.**
