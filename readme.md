This batch file will reset your 5gb limit on MegaDownloader.

Run 'megafix.bat' as admin every time your download stops or hits a very slow speed.

You *don't* have to reboot your computer, router or modem.

Just run the batch, and voila.


**I haven't tested this on too many Windows machines, so YMMV.**
